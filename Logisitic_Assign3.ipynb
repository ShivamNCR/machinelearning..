    "#How It Works:\n",
    "Define the Parameter Grid: A grid of hyperparameters is defined. This involves specifying a list of values for\n",

    "Cross-Validation Setup: Select a cross-validation strategy, typically k-fold cross-validation, where the data \n",
    "is split into 'k' subsets. The model is trained on 'k-1' subsets and tested on the remaining subset. This \n",

    "Exhaustive Search: Grid Search CV exhaustively tries every combination of hyperparameters from the grid on the\n",
