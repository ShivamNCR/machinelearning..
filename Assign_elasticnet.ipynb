    "\n",
    "1.Lasso Regression (L1 regularization):\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso regression penalizes the absolute size of the coefficients, which can lead to sparse solutions by shrinking\n",
    "some coefficients to exactly zero. This effectively performs variable selection by selecting only the most\n",
    "important predictors and discarding the less important ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Ridge Regression (L2 regularization):\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge regression penalizes the squared size of the coefficients, which leads to shrinking all coefficients \n",
    "towards zero but rarely to exactly zero. This helps to deal with multicollinearity by reducing the impact of \n",
    "correlated predictors on the model's performance.\n",
    "However, Ridge regression does not perform variable selection and keeps all predictors in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Elastic Net Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net combines both L1 and L2 penalties, allowing for a more flexible regularization approach. It addresses\n",
    "the limitations of both Lasso and Ridge regression.\n",
    "By combining the penalties, Elastic Net can select groups of correlated variables (like Ridge) while still \n",
    "encouraging sparsity and performing individual variable selection (like Lasso).\n"
