    "Feature selection is a crucial process in building a logistic regression model, particularly when dealing with\n",

    "selection in logistic regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using L1 Regularization (Lasso Regression)\n",
    "L1 regularization, also known as Lasso regression, is a technique that involves adding a penalty equal to the\n",
    "absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients to the loss function. This can lead to some coefficients being \n",
    "shrunk to zero, effectively removing those features from the model. It is particularly useful for feature \n",
    "selection because it simplifies the model by keeping only the most significant features.\n",

    "\n",
    "4. Feature Importance from Model Coefficients\n",
    "In logistic regression, the coefficients can indicate the importance of each feature when predicting the \n",
    "target variable. Features with coefficients (in absolute value) close to zero have less impact on the \n",
    "prediction, while those with larger coefficients are more important. By examining the coefficients, \n",

    "\n",
    "5. Chi-Square Test for Feature Selection\n",
    "For categorical features, the chi-square test can be used to determine whether the presence or absence of \n",
